    <h1>A Reflection After Watching "Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs Table</h1>
    <h2>Sprint 1.3</h2>
    <h3>4 September 2018</h3>
    
    <p>
      My take on the EDA experience is that it is very different from any standard learning environment I have been in before. 
      It is a much more practical experience and requires effort and teamwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      My impressions are that everyone will be thrown in the deep end (not just me!) and different individuals are likely to excel in different areas so it will be a collaborative environment which requires a lot of patience and determination from everyone in the cohort.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think my main struggles with engaging in this type of culture will be my lack of patience and tendency to get frustrated easily. I think I will enjoy working with others and learning from them and doing so will help me work on myself.
    </p>

        I am excited to work in the EDA environment but of course I am nervous. As Shereef described there are the 2 fears and I certainly have the imposter syndrome as he described it. Before starting phase 0 I hadn't really done any coding so I was worried this would hold me back but Shereef has eased those nerves somewhat.
