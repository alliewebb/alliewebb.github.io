            My take on the EDA experience is that it is very different from any standard learning environment I have been in before. 
            It is a much more practical experience and requires effort and teamwork.

            My impressions are that everyone will be thrown in the deep end (not just me!) and different individuals are likely to excel in different areas so it will be a collaborative environment which requires a lot of patience and determination from everyone in the cohort.

            I think my main struggles with engaging in this type of culture will be my lack of patience and tendency to get frustrated easily. I think I will enjoy working with others and learning from them and doing so will help me work on myself.

            I am excited to work in the EDA environment but of course I am nervous. As Shereef described there are the 2 fears and I certainly have the imposter syndrome as he described it. Before starting phase 0 I hadn't really done any coding so I was worried this would hold me back but Shereef has eased those nerves somewhat.
