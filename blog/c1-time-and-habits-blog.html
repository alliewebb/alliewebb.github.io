    <h1>Reading the Resources on Time and Habits</h1>
    <h2>Sprint 1.3</h2>
    <h3>4 September 2018</h3>
    
    <p>
      The habits and techniques that I tried during the past hour of reading were meditation and posture. Prior to this I have been taking semi-regular breaks and using my lunch time to exercise.

      I found the TedTalk on changing habits by starting extremely small and using a trigger very interesting.
    </p>

      What has been working for me is getting up early and starting to work as soon as I'm showered. This is a technique which always worked best for me at university. I find that as soon as I break it interrupts my flow and I find it difficult to get back in "the zone."

        I would like to try the pomodoro technique in the afternoons as after lunch I find it very difficult to focus. I am also going to try to practice meditation outside of time set aside for working, and I have downloaded the Headspace app which was recommended by the first blog to assist me in that.
