            They are essentially the same thing. They are both about reflecting/paying attention in a non-judgmental way that is not affected by emotion.

            I tried the Body Scan. It was a good way to look into exactly where I was holding tension in my body, and although my body was mostly relaxed, my back, neck and shoulders were definitely holding the most tension.
            It was very relaxing to slowly scan down through the body and I flet refreshed afterwards.

            That our emotions do not define us. They are not elements of who we are as people. An emotion is an experience which can be focussed on, dismissed, let go or let be. We can trian our minds to do any of these things. 
            I think it's an interesting quirk of the english language that our emotions and changeable feelings such as "I am happy" or "I am thirsty" are expressed in the same way that permanent traits such as "I am human" are.
            It took so long when learning Spanish to distinguish between "ser" (the verb "to be" in its permanent state) and "estar" (non-permanent way of saying "to be"), however once speaking Spanish for a while it seems so obvious that they are separate things.
            I think that is a good thing to remember when coming across emotions - thinking of them as feelings rather than personality traits.
