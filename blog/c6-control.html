            One of my main triggers is when there is an exercise that I don't even know where to begin. I often get so flustered that I don't even know what the first step in answering the question is. It's hard to try things when you don't know what to try. At this point I forget that I have all of the resources at my fingertips - the course recommended resources, google, my cohort, teachers...
            Another trigger is when I believe I've got the correct idea but there is still a bug. I am often so annoyed that I miss simple syntax bugs.

            I loved this. I have a situation resurfacing right now with an old friend that I still don't understand why I get worked up over it. I used that situation while doing the SBNRR exercise and I feel like I have a deeper understanding of why it affects me, and a deeper understanding of why she acted the way she did.
            It will be a great skill to use after an event, but as the book states a little tricky in the moment when it involves reacting to other people.
