        <h4>Questions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>What is grid based design?</strong><br>
            Grid based design is taking a look at the mockup of the webpage you would like to create and dividing it up into grids that fit that design. Generally each grid will take up a proportion of the page divisible by 12 eg.(3/12, 4/12, 6/12, 12/12)</li>
            <li><strong>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong><br>
            Responsive webpages make it easier to view the page on any type of device, regardless of size.</li>
            <li><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong><br>
            Semantic structure is tagging elements of the page to label them more clearly and make it easier to make chenges to certain elements individually.</li>
            <li><strong>Other reflections</strong><br>
            I think bootstrap will be very interesting to play around with, and combined with google fonts it should be a lot of fun to try out creating sites in spare time.</li>
